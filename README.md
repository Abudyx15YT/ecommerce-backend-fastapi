This project leverages a range of powerful technologies to deliver a robust e-commerce solution:

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication.
- **OAuth2**: Standard for access delegation, used for secure API access.
- **Swagger UI**: A tool for documenting APIs, providing a user-friendly interface.
